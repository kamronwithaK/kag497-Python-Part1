# Lecture
## Python :snake:

Today we will be learning about Python! This lab session will be more self-guided than the last, so we'll get to downloading everything pretty soon.

## *Python for Everybody*

*Python for Everybody* is a free online textbook published under the Creative Commons Licence that is a great starter and reference guide for python.  Most of the lab excersises will be based on sections of *Python for Everybody* - in fact, its a great starting reference and could contain hints to solving every excersise, should you get stuck.  It breaks down the basics of python and programming as a whole, as many of the concepts we'll cover talking about python apply to almost every programming language.  The book itself is availible for purchase if you're *really* interested in a print copy, but it available as a PDF and epub from the writer for free.  Some sections of *Python for Everybody* have been adapted from another book, *How to think like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python* by Allen Downey, Jeff Elkner and Chris Meyers.  This book is also available for free online.

If you want to dive a little deeper into the topics you'll be learning about, read chapters 2 & 3 of *Python for Everybody*.

## Getting Startedâ„¢

1. Log into SCI JupyterHub and start a terminal
2. Type in `git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/Python-Part1.git` and hit the enter key
3. This should download a folder to your JupyterHub with the lab (it should be called `Python-Part1`)
4. Double click the new folder in the file explorer. You should see the lab contents.
5. Launch the `Lab-Exercises.ipynb` notebook. You can also launch `Lab-Lesson.ipynb` if you need a refresher on what the UTA went over in the skills lab.

### If JupyterHub doesn't work for you

Use Binder!

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

## Completing the Lab

You can modify `Lab-Exercises.ipynb`. Add your own cells, but don't delete the original problems - this helps us match up your answers to each exercise and check that you did all of the work. Don't forget to rename your lab -> `<pitt username>-Lab-Exercises.ipynb` where the <pitt username> is your username. For example, if my username is abc123, I would rename the lab to `abc123-Lab-Exercises.ipynb`.

## Submitting your lab

We will use [Canvas](canvas.pitt.edu) to let you upload your labs. 

1. First, if you used the SCI JupyterHub, Virtual Lab, or Binder, you're going to have to download the notebook to your computer.
    * On JupyterHub, right click on your exercise notebook on your file browser on the left
    * Click **Download** and save it somewhere

2. Then, go to Canvas to upload your lab.
    * In Canvas, click on our class
    * Go to Assignments
    * Click on the Skills Lab assignment for this week
    * Click **Submit Assignment** in the top right
    * Choose your Notebook file you saved/created/downloaded earlier (will end in `.ipynb`)
    * Hit Submit!

If you are confused, here is a [tutorial](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-upload-a-file-as-an-assignment-submission-in-Canvas/ta-p/274) on how to submit an assignment on Canvas.

**Note:** you can re-upload your lab as many times as you want before the deadline.
